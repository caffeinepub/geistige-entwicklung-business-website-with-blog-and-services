Store a local marker (e.g., localStorage) keyed by the computed local date (YYYY-MM-DD) and only trigger the daily-visitor tracking mutation when the stored date differs from today. Ensure this tracking runs on the public site (e.g., on homepage load) and continues to respect the existing visitor-only rule (admin activity must not be counted).",
